######### README FILE


Use the activate and deactivate python script as a shelf item to initialize the github folder location as a user script path.

This script will copy any current userSetup, userHotkeys and any other user files. It renames them with an TEMP_ in the front. When the deactivate script is then run it restores the original user scripts to what they were and takes the gitHub folder out of the Maya python userPaths.
